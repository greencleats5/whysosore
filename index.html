<p> While many aches and pain are nothing to worry about,<br>
  certain types of pain may be a sign of serious trouble </p>

<p> People ask... <br>
  What illness makes your muscles sore? <br>
  Is pain that comes and goes serious? <br>
  What does it mean when your sore is out of nowhere? <br>
  When should I worry about soreness? </p>

<p> I Felt Better Yesterday, <br>
  And Worse Today... <br>
  What's Happening??? </p>

<p> Why Am I Sore When I Wake Up? <br>
   Naturally some morning stiffness:P <br>
   Less blood flow to your muscles </p>

<p>Was feeling a bit hopeful yesterday, <br>
   But... <br>
   I've been having a tough few weeks </p>
